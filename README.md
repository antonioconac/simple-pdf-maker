# Simple PDF Maker
• This is a simple Python script that dynamically generates structured PDF documents from a list of topics and corresponding page counts stored in a CSV file. <br>
• It was fun working on this project because it gave me insight about working with <b>ranges</b>, especially iterating over ranges, also about the <b>fpdf</b> library. Even though it is a simple application, I find it useful and for sure can be developed into something more deep, that'll be able to generate a more meaningful PDF.<br>
• The basic look of a page looks like: <br><br>

• The entire pdf can be found in the structure above, as <b>output.pdf</b><br>
